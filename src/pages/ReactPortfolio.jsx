          Building My React Portfolio
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Creating this portfolio started from a simple HTML and CSS structure. Initially, I had only basic sections like Home, About, and Contact. As I learned more, I wanted to make it dynamic and modern.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          That's when I moved to React. I modularized each section into components like <code>Header</code>, <code>Experience</code>, and <code>Projects</code>. Tailwind CSS helped me rapidly build responsive layouts without writing too much custom CSS.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I integrated `react-router-dom` for navigation and added a blog section where I can post updates or showcase things I learn. I also used `Typed.js` to add some animations to the homepage for that interactive feel.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          This project is a living proof of my journey — from basic static pages to a full dynamic site. It's a way to share what I build, learn, and experiment with.
